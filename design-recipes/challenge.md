1. 
As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.

2. 
# "check_text" method checks whether the text provided includes the string #TODO
result = check_text(text)

text: string provided to parse through
result: a boolean value determining whether the condition has been met

3. 
check_text("task #TODO") => true
check_text("task") => false

check_text("") => throws an error

4. Let's go.

Yay! :)
